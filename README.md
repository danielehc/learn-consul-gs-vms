  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The environment is not intended for production use. It is intended to mimic the behavior of a VM with a container and build test environments to test Consul functionalities without the overhead of deploying a full VM.

 ## Usage examples

You can test the scenario by running:

```shell-session
export DOCKER_REPOSITORY=your-repo && \
    ./provision.sh build_only && \
    ./provision.sh && \
    ./provision.sh operate
```

inside the repository root.

The command will:
* Define the Docker repository to use for building images (`export DOCKER_REPOSITORY=your-repo`)
* Build all needed images locally without pushing to DockerHub (`./provision.sh build_only`)
* Provision the containers according to configuration (`./provision.sh`)
* Configure and deploy Consul on the containers (`./provision.sh operate`)

Read the following sections to more details on what the script does.

### Docker image build 

The folder `images` contains the Dockerfile definition for all the containers 
needed by the scenario.

* `base` - Used by Consul servers, Vault server and Operator node
* `hashicups-<service-name>` - Created from `base` adds necessary configurations
for the service app to run.

### Container naming conventions

* Consul servers will be named `consul-server-${DATACENTER}-${NUMBER}`
* Consul clients hosting services will be named `svc-${DATACENTER}-${SERVICE}`

## Configure scenario

The file `ops/00_global_vars.env` contains the variables useful to tune the 
scenario configuration.

The file is used both in the infrastructure provision and in the deploy so it 
creates consistency in the outcome.

### Main configuration parameters

* `SERVER_NUMBER` (default `3`) - Number of servers to spin up per datacenter
* `DOMAIN` (default `consul`) - Cluster domain
* `PRIMARY_DATACENTER` (default `dc1`) - The name of the primary datacenter

### Datacenter number

* `DATACENTERS` (array) - An array of strings. Each string defines a datacenter name.
For each string in the array the script will create `SERVER_NUMBER` containers and
configure them as Consul servers in the datacenter named as the string.

By default the first value of the array should match `PRIMARY_DATACENTER` value.

**Example:** If `DATACENTERS=("dc1" "dc2")` then the script will create 6 Consul container.
3 named `consul-server-dc1-x` (with `1` <= `x` <= `${SERVER_NUMBER}`)
3 named `consul-server-dc2-x` (with `1` <= `x` <= `${SERVER_NUMBER}`)

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> All the datacenters created will automatically be federated using WAN federation
</p></div>

### Scenario services - Still not completely defined

* `SERVICES` (array) - An array of strings. Each string defines a service name.
For each string in the array the script will create a container named 
`svc-${DATACENTER}-${SERVICE}`. The same services are created in **ALL** 
datacenters mentioned by the `DATACENTERS` variable.


* `SVC_MATCH_IMAGE_NAME=true` - If set to `true` the script will use Docker images 
with the same name of the service to create the environment. If set to `false` 
the `base` image will be used.

* `START_APPS=false` - If set to `true` the script will start the app on the clients.
This is used in case you don't want to deploy a specific application and are using
the `fake-service` binary provided by the `base` image.

### Mesh elements - Still not completely defined

* `MESH_ELEMENTS` (array) - Still not completely defined

## Spin-up environment

```shell-session
./provision.sh
```

Spins up containers for:

* Operator - Simulates a bastion host and is the node that runs all the commands that are necessary to complete the scenario setup
* [Vault][vault] - Used to generate TLS certificates for Consul datacenters
* [Consul][consul] servers
* Services
* Mesh components (Consul gateways) **Still under deployment**

You can verify the containers that are running after the script completes with:

```shell-session
docker ps -q --filter label=tag=instruqt \
    | xargs -n 1 docker inspect \
        --format '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}} {{ .Name }}' \
    | sed 's/ \// /' | sort -V
```

Example output: 

```log
172.20.0.2 vault
172.20.0.3 operator
172.20.0.4 consul-server-dc1-1
172.20.0.5 consul-server-dc1-2
172.20.0.6 consul-server-dc1-3
172.20.0.7 svc-dc1-frontend
172.20.0.8 svc-dc1-payments
172.20.0.9 svc-dc1-product-api
172.20.0.10 svc-dc1-product-api-db
172.20.0.11 svc-dc1-public-api
...
```

## Execute scenario

```shell-session
./provision.sh operate
```

The command combines all the files in the `./ops` folder into a single script, 
copies it into the `operator` container and runs it.

```shell-session
for i in `find ops/*` ; do
    cat $i >> ${ASSETS}scripts/operate.sh
done

chmod +x ${ASSETS}scripts/operate.sh

# Copy script to operator container
docker cp ${ASSETS}scripts/operate.sh operator:/home/app/operate.sh

# Run script
# docker exec -it operator "chmod +x /home/app/operate.sh"
docker exec -it operator "/home/app/operate.sh"
```

The idea is to help development of complex scenarios in a sequential form and by 
splitting long procedures into more manageable scripts containing only a clear 
subset of actions.

## Instruqt compatibility

The script is deployed to have a testbed for Consul advanced scenarios but also 
as a kick-off for the creation of [Instruqt][instruqt] scenarios.

The scripts use the internal Docker DNS to address containers but, if running in 
Instruqt uses the pre-populated `INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID` environment variable to
understand if the scenario is running on a self-hosted environment or in an 
Instruqt sandbox.

## Scenario files

During the scenario creation the script generates some files needed for the Consul
agent configuration, some to store secrets (that in a production environment should 
be stored in a safe location), and some other files that are used during the provision.

### Assets

Once the main scenario completed you can view the files created using:

```shell-session
docker exec -it operator /bin/bash -c "ls -1 /home/app/assets/"
```

### Logs

The scenario produces some logs (and will produce more of them in future versions).

To visualize the available logs:

```shell-session
docker exec -it operator /bin/bash -c "ls -1 /home/app/logs"
```

#### Notable log files

* `certificates.log` - All certificates generated for the scenario in readable format
* `files_created.log` - A summary of the different files created by the different sections

## Clean local files

### Clean environment

Stops and removes the containers used by the environment.

```
./provision.sh clean
```

### Delete Docker images

If you do not have other Docker images created locally you can remove the 
created ones with the following command.

```
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q <your-repo>/*)
```
